### Description

This is a simple datepicker using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
<br>
There are multiple awesome datepickers to use, but most of them have limitations such as UI customization or changing the logic directly.
<br>
This simple component helps you make it your favorite date picker. :)
### How to use

- Just add `script.js` file to your project.
- Using CDNs, this component does not need to install tools for testing and use in the project.
- But I <b>recommend</b> installing <b>Tailwind</b> and <b>Alpine</b> if you haven't already
<br>
<br>
I hope this component helps you!
